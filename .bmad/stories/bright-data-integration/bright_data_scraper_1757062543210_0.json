  "priority": "high",
  "complexity": "large",
  "estimated_hours": 16,
  "tags": ["integration", "scraping", "enrichment", "linkedin", "api"],
  
  "problem_statement": {
    "current_situation": "The system currently relies on Google Custom Search API for finding LinkedIn URLs and basic Apify scraping for profile data. This approach has limitations: (1) CSE provides only snippets, not full profile data, (2) Apify scraping may be rate-limited or blocked, (3) No real-time profile verification, (4) Limited data points available for enrichment, (5) No structured extraction of key profile sections like experience, skills, and recommendations.",
    
    "pain_points": [
      "Incomplete profile data limiting personalization quality",
      "Reliability issues with current scraping methods",
      "No access to premium LinkedIn data points",
      "Inability to verify profile freshness and accuracy",
      "Missing critical business intelligence (company size, funding, tech stack)",
      "No extraction of recent activity or engagement signals"
    ],
    
    "business_impact": "Without comprehensive profile data, the system cannot: (1) Generate highly personalized messages that reference specific achievements or experiences, (2) Qualify prospects effectively based on seniority, tenure, or skill alignment, (3) Identify optimal timing for outreach based on job changes or company events, (4) Build accurate Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) from enriched data patterns."
