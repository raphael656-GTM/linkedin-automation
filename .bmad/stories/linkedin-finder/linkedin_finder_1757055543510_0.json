  "description": "Implement tiered search strategies that prioritize accuracy over coverage.\n        \nCurrent Problem:\n- 8 strategies with progressively broader searches\n- Falls back to overly broad searches that return wrong results\n- Example: Searching for \"Kelly O'Neill\" returns \"Arianna Bonn√©\"\n\nSolution:\n1. Implement 3-tier strategy system:\n   - Tier 1: Exact match strategies (name + company + title)\n   - Tier 2: High-confidence strategies (name + company variations)\n   - Tier 3: OPTIONAL fallback (only if user explicitly allows)\n2. Add confidence scoring to each result\n3. Return \"Not Found\" rather than wrong person\n4. Track which strategy produced the result",

    "Only 3-4 high-precision strategies implemented",
    "Each strategy has a confidence score",
    "Broad searches are opt-in only",
    "Clear logging of which strategy succeeded"
