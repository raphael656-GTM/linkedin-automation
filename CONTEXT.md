5. **GovernanceArchitect.js** - `/Users/raphaelberrebi/sub-agents/specialists/tier3/`
   - Compliance, policy enforcement, governance frameworks
   - Regulatory landscape and organizational analysis
   - Enterprise governance and risk management

**Existing:**
- `SystemArchitect.js` - High-level system architecture and design

### 4. Enhanced Core Systems - COMPLETED ✅

#### TaskComplexityAnalyzer (Enhanced)
**Location:** `/Users/raphaelberrebi/sub-agents/routing/TaskComplexityAnalyzer.js`
**New Analysis Dimensions Added:**
- **Temporal Complexity** - Urgency, timelines, long-term strategic impact
- **Stakeholder Complexity** - Approvals, cross-functional coordination needs
- **Uncertainty Level** - Research needs, experimental work, unknown scope
- **Dependency Complexity** - External systems, blocking factors, prerequisites

**Enhanced Features:**
- Multi-dimensional scoring with 8 complexity factors
- Contextual adjustments based on risk and uncertainty combinations
- Confidence scoring and reasoning generation
- More sophisticated domain analysis with weighted keywords
- Technical term recognition for improved accuracy

#### QualityAssurance Framework (Expanded)
**Location:** `/Users/raphaelberrebi/sub-agents/quality/QualityAssurance.js`
**New Validation Dimensions Added:**
- **Maintainability** - Code quality, documentation, modularity
- **Scalability** - Horizontal/vertical scaling, load capacity
- **Usability** - User experience, interface design, learning curve
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance, screen reader support
- **Sustainability** - Environmental impact, energy efficiency
- **Adaptability** - Configuration flexibility, future-proofing
- **Testability** - Unit/integration/e2e testing capabilities
- **Observability** - Logging, monitoring, tracing, metrics
- **Compliance** - Data protection, privacy, regulatory requirements

**Enhanced Features:**
- 16 total validation dimensions (7 original + 9 new)
- Weighted scoring system with contextual adjustments
- Detailed improvement suggestions for each dimension
- Comprehensive assessment methods with real analysis logic

#### Context Storage System (Verified Complete)
**Location:** `/Users/raphaelberrebi/sub-agents/context/ContextManager.js`
**All 4 Storage Implementations Present:**

1. **ProjectContextStorage** - Project state, decisions, constraints management
2. **SpecialistCacheStorage** - Consultation caching with expiration and eviction
3. **PatternLibraryStorage** - Pattern management with relevance scoring
4. **AnalyticsLogStorage** - Event logging with size management

**Additional Components:**
- **ContextFlowController** - Context flow management and updates
- **LearningSystem** - Pattern analysis and routing optimization

## Architecture Patterns
All specialists follow consistent BaseSpecialist pattern:
- Constructor with id, name, domain, tier, expertise, handoffCriteria
- `analyze()` method for task analysis
- `generateRecommendations()` method with structured output
- Helper methods for domain-specific logic
- Complexity handling up to tier-appropriate levels (Tier 2: 8, Tier 3: 10)
- Timeline estimation and handoff criteria evaluation
